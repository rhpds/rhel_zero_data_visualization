In this step, you will visualize the data from your MySQL database.

Switch to the `+Grafana (Podman)+` tab of the lab environment.

First, Click the menu button in the upper-left of Grafana, and then
click `+Dashboards+`.

Next, click `+New+` then click `+New Dashboard+`.

Click on `+Add Visualization+`

Select MySQL as your data source.

You will now see a blank dashboard editor.

In the query section, select the following options: * Format: `+Table+`
* Filter: Disabled * Group: Disabled * Order: Disabled * Preview:
Enabled * Dataset: `+Population+` * Table: `+Singapore_Population+` *
Column: `+*+`

After you have entered the configuration listed above, the query editor
box should look like this:

Here is what that configuration means: * The format is set to `+Table+`
because our SQL data is formatted as a table. * `+Population+` is the
name of the MySQL database you are accessing * Within the `+Population+`
database, you are importing data from a table called
`+Singapore_Population+` * The `+*+` selection for column indicates that
you are importing all columns. * The Aggregation and Alias sections can
be left blank as we are not transforming our data in this lab.

After selecting the query options, click `+Run query+` and then click
`+Zoom to data+`.

You will now see a graph of Singaporeâ€™s population from 1972-2022.

However, our database contains data from 1950-2022, so we want Grafana
to query all of the data, not just the first 50 entries. To edit your
SQL query, click on `+Code+` in your query configuration options:
image:../assets/grafana_select_code.png[../assets/grafana_select_code]

From the code editor, remove the part that says `+LIMIT 50+`, and then
click on `+Run query+`

Now Grafana is querying all of our data, but there is still one problem.
We need to adjust the scale of our graph so we can see the output. Click
`+Change time settings+` and select `+Coordinated Universal Time+` from
the drop-down box. Next, click on the time range above the graph and
enter the following settings for the absolute time range: * From:
`+1950-01-01 00:00:00+` * To: `+2022-01-01 00:00:00+`

Then click `+Apply time range+` to apply your selections.

Now, you will see all of your data in the graph.

Enter a title for your graph and then click `+Save+` to save your graph.

Finally, when prompted, enter a name for your dashboard and click
`+Save+`.

You will now see your data dashboard!
